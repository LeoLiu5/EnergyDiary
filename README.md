# Energy Diary - Monitoring daily Energy Usage in CE Lab

In the CE lab located in UCL East, various electronic devices have been implemented for teaching and researching purposes. Energy Diary connects to the CE MQTT server and displays real-time energy usage data for these electronic devices, including two Samsung screens, four Prusa printers, and the soldering station. 

Instead of directly reading JSON formatted data strings from MQTT, Energy Diary presents energy data in an easy-to-understand, attractive, and interactive form.

The goal is to help the lab technician, staff, or students track daily electricity and energy consumption. This application also has the potential to help users reduce their carbon footprint by reminding them of their electricity and power consumption.


## Features

- When users open the App, they will be introduced to a login page: 
  - <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/Login.png">

- If the user does not have an account, they need to click on "Register here" and create an account. Users can switch between the login and the sign-up page freely by clicking the "go back" button: 
  - <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/Sign%20up.png">

- On the sign-up page, users can enter their email addresses and create a password for their accounts. If the email has been used before, a notification message will appear below to remind the user that the account has already been created: 
  - <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/existing%20account.png">
  

- If the user forgets to enter a password or the password is too short, a notification message will appear below to ask the user to create a new password: 
  - <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/no%20password.png">       <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/weak%20password.png">
 
- If the email address is invalid, a notification message will appear below to ask the user to enter a correct email address:
  - <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/invalid%20eamil.png">
 


 
- After users signed up, they will be returned to the login page. Now users can log in to their just-created accounts. After clicking the "log in" button, users will be directed to the welcome page: 
  - <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/Welcome%20page.png">
  
- Users can change the displaying pattern by clicking the icon at the top right corner: 
  - <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/Change%20view.png">

- By clicking on one of the images, users will be directed to the corresponding electronic device's information page. However, users have to wait until the application connects to the CE MQTT server: 
  - <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/Connecting%20to%20MQTT.png">
  

- After successfully connecting to the CE MQTT server, energy data for this electronic device will be displayed on its unique information page:  
  - <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/Information_page1.png">   <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/Information_page2.png">

- Each information page contains:
   - A "Power Consumption" section: showing information on "Active Power (the power which is consumed or utilized in an AC circuit)", "Reactive Power (the power associated with Inductors and Capacitors of the circuit)", and "Apparent Power (the combination of Active Power and Reactive Power)"
   - An "Energy Usage" section: showing information on "Total Energy Consumption", "Today's Energy Consumption", "Yesterday’s Energy Consumption", and "Change in Energy Consumption"
   - An "⚡️ Electricity" section: showing information on "Voltage" and "Current"
   - A "⚡️ Graph" section: displaying daily energy usage on a line chart
   
- There is an information page for each of the following electronic devices from the CE lab:  
  - Peter, Prusa MMU2S Multi-Filament Printer 1
  - Pertuina, Prusa MMU2S Single-Filament Printer 2
  - Paul, Prusa MMU2S Single-Filament Printer 3
  - Penelope, Prusa MMU2S Multi-Filament Printer 4
  - Sally, Samsung Screen 1
  - Sammy, Samsung Screen 2
  - Sandy, the Soldering Station



      
      
## Data Feed and Database

- [Three GOSUND Smart Plugs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Google-Control-Monitoring-Function-Required/dp/B0983HNB7M/ref=asc_df_B0983HNB7M/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=535047026873&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7351062071157182144&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9044962&hvtargid=pla-1393506937628&psc=1&th=1&psc=1) are implemented around the CE Lab. They are responsible for collecting the energy data and publishing them to the CE MQTT Server.

- Then, the CE MQTT Server provides the energy data directly to Energy Diary.

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/mqtt.png">

- In addition, the backend of the app connects to Cloud Firestore and pushes the energy consumption data directly to the collection called "Date".

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary/blob/main/EnergyDiary/assets/cloud%20firestore.png">

- Finally, the app fetches energy consumption data based on the specific date and electronic device. The "monthly energy usage" graphs from the information pages are generated using the fetched data from Cloud Firestore.
