# Energy Diary - Monitoring daily Energy Usage in CE Lab

Energy Diary can connect to your local MQTT server and collect your energy usage data. Compared to MQTT, Energy Diary will present everything in an easy-to-understand, attractive, and interactive form. 
The expected function of this smart energy app is to help the user track down their daily electricity and energy consumption. This application also has the potential to help users reduce their carbon footprint by connecting electricity and power usage data to mobile devices.


## Features

- A welcome user interface (an overview menu of the app)

   - A "Power Consumption" section: showing information on "Active Power (the power which is consumed or utilized in an AC circuit)", "Reactive Power (the power associated with Inductors and Capacitors of the circuit)", and "Apparent Power (the combination of Active Power and Reactive Power)"
   - An "Energy Usage" section: showing information on "Total Energy Consumption", "Today's Energy Consumption", "Yesterday’s Energy Consumption", and "Change in Energy Consumption"
   - An "⚡️ Electricity" section: showing information on "Voltage" and "Current"

- [Three GOSUND Smart Plugs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Google-Control-Monitoring-Function-Required/dp/B0983HNB7M/ref=asc_df_B0983HNB7M/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=535047026873&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7351062071157182144&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9044962&hvtargid=pla-1393506937628&psc=1&th=1&psc=1) are implemented around the CE Lab. They are responsible for collecting the energy data and publishing them to the CE MQTT Server.

- Then, the CE MQTT Server provides the energy data directly to Energy Diary.
