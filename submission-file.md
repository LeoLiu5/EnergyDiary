Flutter Application Name - Energy Diary
GitHub Repository - [https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary](https://github.com/LeoLiu5/EnergyDiary)

## Introduction to Application

In the CE lab located in UCL East, various electronic devices have been implemented for teaching and researching purposes. Energy Diary connects to the CE MQTT server and displays real-time energy usage data for these electronic devices, including two Samsung screens, four Prusa printers, and the soldering station. Energy Diary also pushes daily energy usage data to Cloud Firebase and displays them in "monthly energy usage" graphs.

Instead of directly reading JSON formatted data strings from MQTT or Cloud Firebase, Energy Diary presents energy data in an easy-to-understand, attractive, and interactive form.

The goal is to help the lab technician, staff, or students track daily electricity and energy consumption. This application also has the potential to help users reduce their carbon footprint by reminding them of their electricity and power consumption.

Each electronic device contains:

A "Power Consumption" section: showing information on "Active Power (the power which is consumed or utilized in an AC circuit)", "Reactive Power (the power associated with Inductors and Capacitors of the circuit)", and "Apparent Power (the combination of Active Power and Reactive Power)".

An "Energy Usage" section: showing information on "Total Energy Consumption", "Today's Energy Consumption", "Yesterday‚Äôs Energy Consumption", and "Change in Energy Consumption".

An "‚ö°Ô∏è Electricity" section: showing information on "Voltage" and "Current".

A "‚ö°Ô∏è Graph" section: displaying daily energy usage on a line chart.
